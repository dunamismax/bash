## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dunamismax/bash.git
   cd bash
   ```

2. **Run a Script**:
   Navigate to the desired script (e.g., `freebsd/install-v2.sh` or `linux/ubuntu/install.sh`), make it executable, and run it:

   ```bash
   chmod +x script_name.sh
   ./script_name.sh
   ```

   Most scripts require `sudo` for system-level changes.

3. **Customize**:
